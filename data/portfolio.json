I don't just build beautiful interfaces; I build them right. I love the challenge of taking a creative vision and translating it into clean, high-performing code that makes users go, \"Wow, that was easy!\" Essentially, I'm a hybrid builder, fluent in both the aesthetic and the technical, ensuring every project is functional, efficient, and visually compelling.\n\nOutside of coding, my life is powered by a couple of non-screen passions (mostly). I'm a massive hockey fan and love being around that high-energy, fast-paced atmosphere. When I need to really switch off, I'm diving deep into a new world with video games on my days off. It’s my perfect way to balance intense focus with a bit of escapism and fun.","resume":{"tagline":"UX UI Designer with Development Experience","description":"UI/UX Designer and brand specialist with 8+ years crafting visual identities and creative campaigns for tech and B2B SaaS.
